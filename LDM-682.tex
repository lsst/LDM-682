\setDocAbstract{%
A major product of the nightly processing of LSST images is a world-public stream of alerts from transient, variable, and moving sources. Science users may access these alerts through third-party community brokers, which will receive the LSST alerts, add scientific value, and redistribute them to the scientific community.
 
This document is a call for Letters of Intent (LOIs) to propose a community broker, as described in ``Plans and Policies for LSST Alert Distribution'' \citedsp{LDM-612}.
}

\maketitle


\section{Guidelines}

\subsection{Page Limits}

LOIs should be no more than 4 \textbf{TBC} pages, with standard margins and font sizes.

\subsection{Due Date}

For full consideration, LOIs should be submitted by May 15, 2019 \textbf{TBC}.

\subsection{Content}

The LOI should address at a high level the following items:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scientific goals of the proposed broker system
	\item Anticipated data products \& services
	\item Envisioned technical implementation
	\item Prospects for funding broker construction and operations
	\item Description of proposing team
	\item Relevant experience 
\end{itemize}

It is understood that proposed brokers may be in formative stages at the time of this call.

\section{Broker Workshop}


LOI submitters are invited to attend a workshop in Seattle the week of June 17, 2019.
This technical workshop will bring together LSST Project personnel, representatives of the LSST Science Collaborations, and proposers of community brokers.  
Topics of discussion will include LSST-broker interfaces, architecture and technology choices, the broker selection process, policy issues, science use cases and expectations, and development progress from precursor surveys.
Please see \textbf{website?} for more information.
